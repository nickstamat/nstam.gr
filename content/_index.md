My name is Nikolaos. I'm an electrical & computer engineer, focused on computer science & software engineering.

Being an avid Linux enthusiast, a couple of years ago I got the chance to go "all in" with cloud technologies, DevOps and SRE, and I haven't looked back since.

Some of my favorite tools include:

- Ansible
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform

...and plenty of other [cloud native](https://landscape.cncf.io/) projects.

Currently I'm working at [Parkside](https://www.parkside-interactive.com/), in the charming city of Graz, Austria.

When not working, you'll find me cycling, fiddling with electronics, or reading about and contributing to open-source software.
